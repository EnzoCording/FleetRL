Installation
============

**Prerequisites**

FleetRL requires Python >=3.8. Python >= 3.10 is strongly recommended.

.. note::

    The creation of a virtual environment is strongly recommended. To be able to use GPU compute,
    CUDA drivers must be installed (11.8 was mostly used during development).

Installation via Github repository:
 * Unzip the package
 * Rename directory from FleetRL-master to FleetRL
 * cd into /FleetRL
 * pip install -r requirements.txt

.. note::

    On remote environments on vast.ai it can be necessary to run pip install -U numpy prior to
    installing FleetRL
