FleetRL - Realistic RL environments for commercial EV fleets
===================================
Github: https://github.com/EnzoCording/FleetRL

Software features:
--------------
- Base-derived class architecture and easily interchangeable configurations
- Modular implementation approach for easily extendable model and methods
- PEP8 compliant (unified code style)
- Documented functions and classes
- Stable-Baselines3 integration, parallelization, tensorboard support
- Extensive data logging and evaluation possibilities

Unique Implementations:
-------------
- Non-linear battery degradation
- Fleet schedule generation - inspired by emobpy and applied to commercial fleets
- Bi-directional charging
- Building load, grid connection limit, PV, spot price
- Arbitrarily variable episode length, 15-min time resolution
- Benchmarking of RL methods with static benchmarks: uncontrolled charging, night charging, distributed charging
- **Benchmarking of RL methods with linear optimization**
