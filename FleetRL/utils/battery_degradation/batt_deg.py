        This is the parent class for degradation methods. Any new implemented method must follow this style of inputs
        and outputs. Then, the method can be used in FleetRL by changing one line of code in the import.

        The degradation methods in FleetRL are implemented such that degradation is calculated in real-time. In the
        step method of the environment class, the current SoH is calculated by SoH -= degradation
